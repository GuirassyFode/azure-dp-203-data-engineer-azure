# Azure Data Explorer (ADX) Deployment and KQL Basics

This project guides you through the deployment of an Azure Data Explorer (ADX) cluster, Microsoft's powerful big data analytics platform. You'll learn how to create a table, ingest data into it, and execute basic Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries. KQL powers the analytics capabilities in ADX, offering a rich language designed for real-time, large-scale data analytics.

## Introduction
